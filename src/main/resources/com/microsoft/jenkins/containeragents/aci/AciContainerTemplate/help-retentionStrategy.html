    <b>Container Once Retention Strategy</b><br/>
    For each job in the queue, an own docker container is started. Once the job has finished, the container is shut down.<br/><br/>
    <b>Container Idle Retention Strategy</b><br/>
    Based on the workload provided by the queue (load average), new docker containers are started on demand. After the job(s) have finished, the container is not shut down immediately. <br/>
    If no new job was executed on this slave/container during the period of the Idle delay, the container is shut down. Retention time 0 means never being deleted automatically.
