    <p>
    If it uses a private ip address, then information about the vnet and the subnet are mandatory. The resource group is
        optional. If it is not filled, then the resource group of container instance is used.
    </p>
    <p>
    Important: Vnet and subnet has to be created in the correct resource group before launching the Container agent and
        the subnet delegation must be enabled.
